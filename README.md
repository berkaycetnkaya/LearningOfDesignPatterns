Design Patterns - Learning Journey
Welcome to my repository where I document my journey through learning and implementing Design Patterns in software development. This repository contains various examples, notes, and code implementations related to different design patterns in C# and other programming languages.

ðŸ“– About
Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. By learning them, I aim to:

Understand how to write more maintainable, scalable, and efficient code.

Improve my problem-solving skills and become more familiar with best practices.

Use design patterns to tackle common software development challenges, making my code more flexible and easier to understand.

ðŸš€ Project Structure
This repository contains different branches, each focusing on a specific design pattern. Each pattern includes:

A brief explanation of the pattern.

Code examples illustrating how the pattern can be implemented in real-world scenarios.

Use cases and when to use each pattern.

My personal notes and insights gathered during the learning process.
